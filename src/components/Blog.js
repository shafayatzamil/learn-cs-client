        <p>
          CORS is shorthand for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism
          to allow or restrict requested resources on a web server depend on
          where the HTTP request was initiated. This policy is used to secure a
          certain web server from access by other website or domain.

          Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
          implement authentication?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs,
          and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It
          supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular
          federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and
          password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina
          scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.

        <p>
          PrivateRoute component is the blueprint for all private routes in the
          application. If the user is logged in, go on and display the component
          in question; otherwise, redirect the user to sign-in page.
          Additionally, we can define the logic of isLogin utility function
          separately in utils folder.

        <p>
          Node.js is an open-source backend javascript runtime environment. It
          is a used as backend service where javascript works on the server-side
          of the application. This way javascript is used on both frontend and
          backend. Node.js runs on chrome v8 engine which converts javascript
          code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and
          data-intensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js accepts the request from the clients and sends the response,
          while working with the request node.js handles them with a single
          thread. To operate I/O operations or requests node.js use the concept
          of threads. Thread is a sequence of instructions that the server needs
          to perform. It runs parallel on the server to provide the information
          to multiple clients. Node.js is an event loop single-threaded
          language. It can handle concurrent requests with a single thread
          without blocking it for one request.
